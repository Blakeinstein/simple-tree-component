# Scrolling

The dropdown-container normally correctly changes its position, if you scroll the whole page and change the position of the select-box.

If you want to block scrolling on the page or a specific container, while the dropdown-container is opened you can use
the `scrollContainer` option. This prevent's the scroll-event on the given `Element`.
